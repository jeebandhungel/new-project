## Main Parts of a Motherboard and Their Functions

### 1. CPU Socket
The CPU socket is the physical slot on the motherboard where the processor is installed. It holds the CPU in place and provides the electrical connections needed for power and data transfer. Each motherboard supports specific socket types (such as Intel LGA or AMD AM series), so processor compatibility depends entirely on the socket.

### 2. Chipset
The chipset is a group of controller chips on the motherboard that manages communication between the CPU and other components like RAM, storage devices, and expansion cards. It controls system features such as USB ports, PCIe lanes, memory speed support, and overclocking capability. The type of chipset determines whether the motherboard is entry-level, gaming, or professional-grade.

### 3. RAM Slots (Memory Slots)
RAM slots are used to install memory modules. The number of slots and their type determine the maximum memory capacity and speed supported by the system. Some motherboards support dual-channel or quad-channel memory, which improves performance by allowing multiple memory modules to work together.

### 4. PCIe (Expansion) Slots
PCIe slots allow users to install expansion cards such as graphics cards, sound cards, network cards, and capture cards. These slots follow the PCIe standard, which defines data transfer speeds. More PCIe slots provide greater flexibility for future upgrades.

### 5. Storage Ports (SATA and M.2)
Storage ports are used to connect hard drives and solid-state drives. SATA ports are commonly used for HDDs and standard SSDs, while M.2 slots support high-speed NVMe SSDs that significantly improve boot time and application performance.

### 6. Voltage Regulation Modules (VRMs)
VRMs regulate and supply stable voltage to the CPU and other critical components. They convert power from the power supply into usable levels. High-quality VRMs are essential for system stability, especially during heavy workloads or overclocking.

### 7. BIOS / UEFI Chip
The BIOS or UEFI chip contains firmware that starts the computer when it is powered on. It performs hardware checks and loads the operating system. UEFI is the modern version of BIOS and provides a graphical interface, faster boot times, and better support for modern hardware.

### 8. Cooling System and Protection Circuits
Motherboards include heat sinks, thermal pads, and sometimes small fans to cool important components like the chipset and VRMs. Protection circuits safeguard the system from overheating, voltage spikes, and short circuits, increasing hardware reliability.

### 9. CMOS Battery
The CMOS battery maintains system settings such as date, time, and BIOS configurations when the computer is turned off or unplugged. If the battery fails, the system loses its saved settings.

### 10. Integrated Audio Circuit
This component provides sound output and input functionality through audio ports. Integrated audio eliminates the need for a separate sound card for most users and supports basic to high-definition audio.

### 11. Integrated Network Circuit
The integrated network controller allows the computer to connect to a network through Ethernet or Wi-Fi. It enables internet access and communication without requiring a separate network card.

### 12. Power Connectors
Power connectors supply electricity from the power supply unit (PSU) to the motherboard and CPU. These connectors ensure that all components receive the required power to function correctly.
