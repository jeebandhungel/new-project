1. Software Requirement Engineering (SRE) Process

(8 + 2 = 10 Marks)

Introduction

Software Requirement Engineering (SRE) is a disciplined process of identifying, documenting, validating, and managing the requirements of a software system. It ensures that the developed software meets user needs, business goals, and technical constraints.

Phases of Software Requirement Engineering
1. Requirement Elicitation

This phase focuses on collecting requirements from stakeholders.

Techniques:

Interviews

Questionnaires

Observation

Workshops (JAD)

Prototyping

Challenges:

Incomplete requirements

Conflicting stakeholder needs

2. Requirement Analysis

In this phase, collected requirements are:

Analyzed for feasibility

Checked for ambiguity and inconsistency

Prioritized based on importance

Output: Refined and validated requirement list

3. Requirement Specification

Requirements are documented formally in an SRS document, which includes:

Functional requirements

Non-functional requirements

Constraints

System interfaces

Characteristics of good SRS:

Complete

Consistent

Verifiable

Unambiguous

4. Requirement Validation

Ensures that requirements:

Reflect actual user needs

Are testable and realistic

Validation techniques:

Reviews

Walkthroughs

Prototyping

5. Requirement Management

Handles changes in requirements during development using:

Version control

Change request management

Traceability matrices

Importance of SRE (2 Marks)

Reduces project failure risk

Minimizes cost and rework

Improves communication between developers and clients

Forms the foundation for design, testing, and maintenance

2. IPv6 Advantages and IPv4–IPv6 Migration

(2 + 8 = 10 Marks)

Advantages of IPv6 over IPv4 (2 Marks)

128-bit address space (≈3.4×10³⁸ addresses)

Simplified packet header

Built-in IPsec security

Auto-configuration

Better support for QoS and mobility

No need for NAT

Migration Techniques from IPv4 to IPv6 (8 Marks)
1. Header Translation

IPv4 headers are converted to IPv6 headers and vice versa.

Example: NAT64

Advantages

Enables communication between IPv4-only and IPv6-only systems

Disadvantages

Performance overhead

Breaks end-to-end connectivity

2. Tunneling

IPv6 packets are encapsulated inside IPv4 packets.

Example: 6to4, ISATAP

Advantages

No immediate infrastructure change

Suitable for gradual migration

Disadvantages

Increased latency

Debugging complexity

3. Addressing Modes

(10 Marks)

Definition

Addressing modes define how operands are accessed during instruction execution.

Types of Addressing Modes

Immediate Addressing

Operand is part of instruction

Fast but limited

Direct Addressing

Address of operand is given directly

Indirect Addressing

Instruction refers to a memory location containing the address

Register Addressing

Operand stored in CPU register

Register Indirect Addressing

Register holds memory address

Indexed Addressing

Effective address = base + index

Relative Addressing

Address relative to program counter

Comparison Table
Mode	Advantage	Disadvantage
Immediate	Fast	Limited data
Direct	Simple	Slow memory
Indirect	Large memory access	Extra cycles
Register	Very fast	Limited registers
Indexed	Good for arrays	Complex
Relative	Compact code	Limited jump
4. Cryptography Concepts

(2 + 3 + 5 = 10 Marks)

Encryption & Decryption (2 Marks)

Encryption: Plaintext → Ciphertext

Decryption: Ciphertext → Plaintext

Public Key Cryptography (3 Marks)

Uses two keys:

Public key (shared)

Private key (secret)

Examples: RSA, ECC

Uses

Secure communication

Digital signatures

Secure key exchange

Types of Attacks on Cryptosystem (5 Marks)

Ciphertext-only attack

Known-plaintext attack

Chosen-plaintext attack

Man-in-the-middle attack

Brute-force attack

Example:
Trying all possible passwords → brute-force attack

5. Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)

(10 Marks)

Definition

SOA is an architectural style where software systems are composed of loosely coupled, reusable services communicating over a network.

Characteristics

Loose coupling

Reusability

Interoperability

Platform independence

Example

E-commerce system:

Order service

Payment service

Shipping service

Notification service
